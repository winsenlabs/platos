    //               first time these rules judged real code, and no rule needed
    //               changing to accommodate it.
    //   310 -> 375  +65: WIN-256 makes `providers` real (ADR M0.3 §1 context
    //               4). It is the first adopted context with TWO peer
    //               dependencies, so the first real exercise of the (c)
    //               contracts-only and (d) DAG allow-list rules against

    //               both on its allow-list, and neither rule needed changing.
    //   375 -> 397  +22: WIN-297 adds 20 files making apps/core-api a bootable
    //               composition root (entry point, config, runtime ports,
    //               lifecycle, health, the binding table and their tests) and 2
    //               making apps/mcp-stdio a real stdio binary, minus nothing —
    //               its 9 released placeholders were replaced in place.
    //   397 -> 441  +44: WIN-256 makes `eventing` real (ADR M0.3 §1 row 17).
    //               Again no rule changed — in particular `no-infra-in-core` and
    //               the `eventing -> tenancy` DAG edge held against a context
    //               whose legacy original imported @nestjs, ioredis and a Prisma
    //               client directly.
    //   441 -> 496  +55: WIN-256 makes `skills` real. The files that matter to
    //               these rules are the four driven ports and the fourteen
    //               domain modules: `domain/` and `application/` import
    //               `@platos/kernel`, their own siblings, and the published
    //               `contracts/` of `tenancy` and `files` — nothing else. The
    //               network fetch, the environment-key directory and the
    //               confined runtime are reachable only as port interfaces,
    //               which is what keeps a context that fetches URLs and runs
    //               sandboxed code free of every banned import. No rule needed
    //               changing.
    //   496 -> 547  +51: WIN-256 makes `jobs` real. It is the first adopted
    //               context that CALLS a kernel decoupling port rather than only
    //               holding one — `request-approval.ts` suspends a run through
    //               `DurableRuntime` and `resolve-approval.ts` resumes it — so
    //               the no-infra-in-core and domain-imports-only-kernel rules
    //               judged that shape for the first time here. Neither needed
    //               changing.
    //
    // The branches pinned partial sums because each saw only its own slice:
    // WIN-297 branched from WIN-256 before providers and pinned 310 + 22 = 332;
    // WIN-256's providers tip pinned 375; the eventing branch pinned
    // 397 + 44 = 441, the skills branch pinned 397 + 55 = 452 and the jobs
    // branch pinned 397 + 51 = 448, each blind to the others. All six slices are
    // disjoint and eventing, skills and jobs move this census on INDEPENDENT
    // axes, so the integrated census is their SUM and not any pin:
    // 397 + 44 + 55 + 51 = 547.
    //
    // The two rules WIN-297 exists to exercise both held. Rule (j) now judges

    // rule (a) judges them with @nestjs/* genuinely present in the workspace one
